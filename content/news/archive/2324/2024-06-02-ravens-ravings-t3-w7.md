Hello everyone and welcome to probably the only episode of Raven's Ravings (wah) - that's right, it's me, Raven, writing the newsletter this week! (Yes, I am real, I think)

Both our secretaries are being tortured by exams, and to be fair, I'm not doing much after the events of the last few weeks - from being attacked by campus geese to writing about eating spiders (and considering including cockroaches), destroying multiple universes, and evil spirits destroying humanity in my dissertation about perception of randomness!

You're probably busy revising for your exams this week so we don't have any additional events - but we get the ball rolling with classics like pub, Comp Cafe and FNG. NONETHELESS, you should **JOIN US** and take a **well deserved break!**

And as always, if you are struggling, please get in contact with one of our welfare officers on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) or Raven (@raven0034)! :)

# [🍔 Pub meal 🍔](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w7/pub/)

#### 🕘Monday 3rd June 6pm-8pm📍[The Dirty Duck](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iJNxYLv21FSBirbp6)
#### *THE RETURN OF THE DUCK (a non-aggressive one!)*

The Duck is not closed this week, hallelujah! We were probably all getting a bit bored of Phantom Coach, unless you were a fan of the £1 kid's meals like a certain someone.

Try not to get chased by the hissing geese near DCS and join us from 6pm!

# [☕ Comp cafe ☕](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w7/compcafe/)

#### 🕘Tuesday 4th June 5pm-9pm📍[CS0.06](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c888a421e6f5928c0d038)
#### *Join Snacks Georg in inflating the average snacks consumed by CS students!🍬*

"average person eats 3 snacks a year" factoid actualy just statistical error. average person eats 0 snack per year. Snacks Georg, who lives in DCS cupboards & eats over 10,000 each day, is an outlier adn should not have been counted.

Come fuel your body with *sugar* and *caffeine* at this week's Comp Cafe ~~Pavlov experiment~~, where (as usual) we have **free snacks and free vending on the coffee machine** from 5pm till 7pm ~~assuming you get to the snacks within the first 30 seconds~~!

#### *Eat. Sleep. Game. Repeat?! (Now with more gaming exec) 👾*

Colloquially referred to as Frigay Night Gayming for Pride Month, join us to take a well deserved break (exit loop; eat spider; repeat) at FNG, where we will have **free snacks** and lots of **games** as usual!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Best of luck with any exams you have left! Please note that eating spiders is an untested method for getting mitigating circumstances!
