Hi guys and welcome back to another edition of everyone's favourite newsletter!

Honestly I think exam season might be driving me crazy, and so I'm here to drive you all insane **too** >:)

This week we have our usual events, and a revision session for some of the first years ~~if you subjected yourself to CS139, not sure why you'd do that~~.

For the most part, there aren't CS exams this week, so I hope you all enjoy your last week of freedom before ***HELL***🔥🔥

But seriously, exam periods can be tough and we want to make sure you are all doing ok. If you are struggling please get in contact with wellbeing services, or speak to one of our welfare officers: Serene (@thiswasdumb on Discord) or Raven (@raven0034 on Discord). We've got this!! :D

For everyone studying CS139, we are running a revision session this week where we’re going over some **sweet sweet** web development exam questions. The focus of the session is going to be going over the key things you should know for the exam that come up most years, and also exam technique.

To make up for the lateness of my last newsletter, I'm writing this one early ~~I'm doing everything I can not to revise~~. I hope everyone's week is good and you're all enjoying the sun! - Ray :)
