Hello internet and welcome to *game theory* - uh I mean this weeks **newsletter**.
It's Lucy writing this week's newsletter again. (RIP Ray with their hectic exam schedule)

You're probably busy revising for your exams this week so we don't have any additional events - just the classics like pub, comp cafe and FNG. NONETHELESS, you should **JOIN US** and take a **well deserved break!**

And as always, if you are struggling, please get in contact with one of our welfare officers on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) or Raven (@raven0034)! :)
