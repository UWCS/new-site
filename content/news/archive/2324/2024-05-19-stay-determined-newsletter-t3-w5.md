Helloooooo everyone!
Feeling the *exam stress*? (You aren't alone!) You should come along to some of our events this week to relax and take your mind off revision - or revise *more* if you like???? We have all the usual events, along with **revision sessions** for all the first years doing **CS126** and/or **CS131**! 

Today's newsletter title is from *Undertale* if you didn't know. It's an excellent game and you should all play it. A weird skill I discovered I have for some reason is that I can name most Undertale songs and where they play in the game after only like 2 seconds of audio? I wish I was like that with my degree instead...

And as always, if you are struggling, please get in contact with one of our **welfare officers** on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) or Raven (@raven0034)! :)
