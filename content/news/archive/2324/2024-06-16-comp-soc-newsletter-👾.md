I hope exams went well for everyone and that you are all taking a well deserved break. I personally am spending all day playing Minecraft Skyblock on Hypixel as I write this, but anyway...

You're still here on campus? Excellent! Because we have an **action packed** week coming up to celebrate the end of the academic year! We have *pub* as usual, the long awaited **Alton Towers** trip, a **circle** (with POP after!) AND a weekend of gaming at the **LAN**!! There is something for everyone so come along to some events if you're still around!!

If you are struggling with anything over the summer, you can contact one of our amazing welfare officers on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) or Raven (@raven0034)! :)

We have a final UWCS circle lined up! This one will be in a FIELD, so don't forget POP tickets! It is our social sec's inaugural circle so expect it to be the best you've ever attended. The theme is to show up in your pjamas!

You can get your ticket to POP here: https://tickets.warwicksu.com/ents/event/25332/

#### *Gaming for 48 hours???*

To finish this action packed week off with a bang we are hosting a LAN. In case you weren't aware, a LAN is basically an event where we play games together for the weekend! Feel free to bring your own devices and join us for a whole 48 hours of non-stop gaming! 

We have a guide about LANs here, but you can also bring up any queries in the UWCS discord server: https://uwcs.co.uk/about/lan/

We've got lots of exciting events lined up, such as a **Mario Kart tournament**, **a (analogue horror) movie night** and a **UWCS quiz**. There's so much more though, so be sure to checkout the specific details here: https://draft.uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan/

The LAN starts this Friday at 7pm at LIB2 so be sure to be there!

Pretty sure this is my last newsletter of this academic year. I hope everyone has an amazing summer! Good luck to all those who are graduating, and I'm looking forward to seeing everyone else next year! :)
