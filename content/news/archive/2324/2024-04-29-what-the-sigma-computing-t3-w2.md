Hello gamers! ~~Setting a new record for first late newsletter?~~

ANYWAY, this week we have our usual events, plus one to ~~forget about April exams~~ explore the culturally rich experience of Coventry pubs! 

Although there's no UWCS revision sessions this week, keep an eye out for the DCS run ones 👀. 

Nominations are still open for the **Gaming Coordinator** by-election (which will be taking place at FNG this friday)! If you're interested in running, DM Finn (@flynt251 on Discord), or one of the ex gaming coordinators. There will also be free pizza, ~~as an incentive~~!

Hopefully everyone is coping with exams ~~I don't know of a single person~~ and is ready to face *EVEN MORE EXAMS*!

But seriously, exam periods can be tough and we want to make sure you are all doing ok. If you are struggling please get in contact with wellbeing services, or speak to one of our welfare officers: Serene (@thiswasdumb on Discord) or Raven (@raven0034 on Discord). We've got this!! :D

#### *Time to drink our sorrows away :)*

We are back with a vengeance this term with a pub traversal like no other! One, two, or even three pubs? **FAT CHANCE** - we're gonna hit **7** 😱 because why settle for anything less? 🤔🤔🤔

Join the **CHAOS** at the Bus Interchange at 7pm sharp, as we embark on our heroic voyage: starting at the Oak Inn and finishing at spoons, Coventry won't know what hit 'em. Get ready for a night so unbelievably good you'll be questioning if you've dropped dead already 🫠

Whether you do not do this very often, or a seasoned regular, prepare for this to be certainly one of the events of the year. Do not miss out!
