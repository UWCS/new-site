Helloooooo everybody it's Lucy back with another ~~minecraft lets play video~~ Computing Society newsletter.

I'd like to thank gamer Finn for this epic title. I have been told that my newsletters are *'spreading brainrot'* and I want everybody to know that this is my intention. If I have been victimised by videos of chicken nuggets singing cotton eye joe then *everybody else must suffer as well.* >:)

ANYWAY, this week we have the usual events, along with **milk Monday** and some **3rd year project talks**, so be sure to check both of those out!

If you want to get your hands on some **ABSOLUTELY FIRE UWCS MERCH** then you're IN LUCK my friends. Read ahead to find out more! 🔥 

The pub traversal last night was so good - thanks social secs!! ~~I'm definitely not writing this with a banging hangover.~~ OK onto the actual newsletter! :)
