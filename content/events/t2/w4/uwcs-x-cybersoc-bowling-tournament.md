# UWCS x CyberSoc Bowling Tournament

[*Tickets can be purchased on the WarwickSU website (here)*](https://www.warwicksu.com/venues-events/events/4133/26599/)

## When: Sat 1st Feb @ 7:30pm
## Where: Tenpin Leamington Spa


### Which society is just better?

A great question one would think, but how do we determine?

-A fight to the death?
-Who has got the biggest...membership?
-Who stinks out the lecture hall the least?

### What better way to find out then a mega bowling tournament?

Yes that's right, this is the first ever bowling tournament in UWCS history and the first ever collaboration with our good friends in CyberSoc. 
For only £15 (UWCS member only, join us we are free to join), or £15.85 for others; you are guaranteed at least 3 games each, where the person with the highest score is the winner, and the society with the highest score is the best.

As always, there will be a mystery prize for the top 3 players.

You can either meet us at Tenpin Leamington Spa directly @ 7:30pm or at the University Interchange UW5 @ 6:30pm, where will catch the U1 together.
