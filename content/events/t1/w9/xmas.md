Hello everyone, it is that time of the year again where it is almost Christmas (with 3 days from December I don't think anyone can blame us for this).

And once again UWCS are doing their annual trip to 
Birmingham's Frankfurt Christmas Market  
You may be thinking, why would I ever do this? Well it is the largest authentic German Christmas market outside Germany, so whether you need you to buy presents for family, or just want to scran from Tim Hortons, this is the excursion for you!

I absolutely will be rating your Christmas jumper so if I don't see you in one you'll be in big trouble!
And now for the boring part...
