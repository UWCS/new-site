## When :clock7: : Thursday, 6pm-late
## Where :round_pushpin:: T-Bar @ 6pm OR Leamington Upper Parade @ 7:15pm

### This is the moment you’ve been waiting for... :fire::fire::fire:
The grind. The deadlines. The doom. It all leads up to this.
Prepare yourselves for what is certain to be the defining moment of the term, your uni career, and maybe even your life.

### UWCS Beginning Of An Era Pub Traversal :saluting_face::saluting_face::saluting_face:
We’ve lined up a colossal route with :eight: pubs stretching across the entirety of Leamington, from the Clarendon down to the Jet. It’s time to leave all that stress behind and we promise to actually make it to the end this time (believe me, I'm not allowed to say but you definitely want to make it to the end :grin:).

Whether you’re a veteran traverser (not my best) like myself or someone who doesn't drink much at all, this is the social event of the term. Everyone’s invited (and I expect you to be there) to this mega legendary night.

### Good news! :bus: Buses run until 3 am, so no stress about getting home. 
Bad news? There isn’t any—unless you miss out on this!

So, don’t be boring. Don’t let coursework stop you (it’s what self certs are for, right?).
We are com soc, we are family! Now let’s show everyone how its done!
