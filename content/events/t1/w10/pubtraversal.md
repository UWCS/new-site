Itâ€™s time. All that work, stress, and grind has led to this.
UWCS Beginning Of An Era Pub Traversal is here! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

With :eight: pubs, weâ€™re taking Leamington by storm, from the Clarendon to the Jet. Whether you drink or not, this is the social of the termâ€”so donâ€™t miss it!

ðŸšŒ Buses run till 3 am, so no excuses. Coursework? Self-cert.
We are com soc, we are family. Be there.

â€”Rowan Shields
