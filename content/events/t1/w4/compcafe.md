Computing Cafe exists to help you with any assignments you have! There will be tons of people from different years and differents courses, so you'll find whoever you need.

There is also free coffee from the department vending machine in the common room, so take advantage of that while you can :D

We have decided to finally embrace fall, and so for this comp cafe we will be bringing some fall snacks!
