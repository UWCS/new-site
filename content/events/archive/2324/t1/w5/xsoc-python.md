If you're still here, you're deep into the Python wormhole (i am sorry)

Come to a beginner-friendly course, in collaboration with Warwick AI and Code Soc. There will be an opportunity to learn some valuable coding skills that companies would love to see!

All labs and documents can be found at [go.uwcs.co.uk/python](https://go.uwcs.co.uk/python) and on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGJT7yCaqAQ&list=PLM7py5yAB4FwniKHqApP_0YmFeEvSQnWf)
